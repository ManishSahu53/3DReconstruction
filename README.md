# Dimension

Dimension is Indshine's Structure from Motion software. It is used to estimate
precise 3D location and orientation of images. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your 
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on 
how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

*Dimension* depends on Python 2.7 libraries. List of libraries can be found below:
1.  [OpenCv](https://opencv.org/) Opencv is open source computer vision library.
To install opencv type ```pip install opencv-python```. This will install latest
opencv availabe. Version 3.4.1 was used to develop dimension. To download specific
version of openCV type ```pip install opencv-python==3.4.1 ```

2.  [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) Numpy is to store images as array of numbers.
To install numpy type ```pip install numpy```

3.  [cPickle](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html)The pickle module 
implements a fundamental, but powerful algorithm for serializing and 
de-serializing a Python object structure. This is inbuilt function in python.

4.  [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html) 
This is used to do multicore processing. To install this type
```pip install multiprocessing```

5. [argparse](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/argparse.html)
Argparse is used to parse user input data. Install this type 
```pip install argparse```


```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
